<h1 class="post-title">Antifragile Dev 💪🧑‍💻</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Antifragility</strong> is a term coined by Nassim Taleb in <a href="https://amzn.to/3e1TuWi" target="_blank">a book</a> of the same name, and putting it simply it means:
</p>

<blockquote>
    “A characteristic of someone or something that gets stronger as it suffers harm - up to a certain point”
</blockquote>

<p>
    In that sense, being an antifragile dev means we <strong>learn more by doing things the hard way</strong>.

    <br/>

    Instead of blindly following tutorials or <a href="https://guicommits.com/formal-education-is-dead/">trusting school will teach everything we need</a>, we hack our way by building and making mistakes.
</p>

<p>
    This series is my humble invite for you to <strong>join me as I try to build a microservice architecture in public</strong>.
